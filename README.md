# Personal Pokedex
The purpose of this project was to build a website that showcases information about three pokemon.

## Inspiration
I wanted the interface of this site to feel like you were using a Gameboy Advance. 
The web pages are displayed on the screen of the Gameboy and the buttons were made functional using HTML button elements along
with Javascript event listeners.

### Technology used
`HTML CSS JavaScript AJAX`

### Controls
```
Right Arrow: Next page

Left Arrow: Previous page

A Button: Show more info

B Button: Hide info

Start Button: Return to Home Page
```
